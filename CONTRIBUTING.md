# How do I Contribute?
 ## Adding Features
  Simple. Fork the repository, adding your own features. When I approve, it will be added to "main" and implemented.
 ## Requesting Features
  Use "Issues" to propose a feature. These help me make the community happy and have a better game for everyone :)
### That's all about contributing - and as mentioned in LICENSE this is open-source, and I'll accept contributions if I see they fit the game and will be a great implementation!
