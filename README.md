# The Moving Block
 A simple 2D game!
 This is the repo to an extremely simple game, designed to help beginners learn the concepts of 2D game development using a game library.

# CONTROLS:
 WASD. That's it!

# REQUIREMENTS:
 PyGame version 2.0 or over needed.

Have fun modifying it to your heart's content, and I'll accept most contributions, especially:
 - #### Game sprites
 - #### New levels/level ideas
   

__***Enjoy!***__
